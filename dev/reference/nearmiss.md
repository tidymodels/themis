# Remove Points Near Other Classes

Generates synthetic positive instances using nearmiss algorithm.

## Usage

``` r
nearmiss(df, var, k = 5, under_ratio = 1)
```

## Arguments

- df:

  data.frame or tibble. Must have 1 factor variable and remaining
  numeric variables.

- var:

  Character, name of variable containing factor variable.

- k:

  An integer. Number of nearest neighbor that are used to generate the
  new examples of the minority class.

- under_ratio:

  A numeric value for the ratio of the majority-to-minority frequencies.
  The default value (1) means that all other levels are sampled down to
  have the same frequency as the least occurring level. A value of 2
  would mean that the majority levels will have (at most)
  (approximately) twice as many rows than the minority level.

## Value

A data.frame or tibble, depending on type of `df`.

## Details

This function implements the NearMiss-1 algorithm. All columns used in
this function must be numeric with no missing data.

circle_numeric <- circle_example[, c("x", "y", "class")]

res <- nearmiss(circle_numeric, var = "class")

res <- nearmiss(circle_numeric, var = "class", k = 10)

res <- nearmiss(circle_numeric, var = "class", under_ratio = 1.5)
```
