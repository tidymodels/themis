# Adaptive Synthetic Algorithm

Generates synthetic positive instances using ADASYN algorithm.

## Usage

``` r
adasyn(df, var, k = 5, over_ratio = 1, distance = "euclidean")
```

## Arguments

- df:

  data.frame or tibble. Must have 1 factor variable and remaining
  numeric variables.

- var:

  Character, name of variable containing factor variable.

- k:

  An integer. Number of nearest neighbor that are used to generate the
  new examples of the minority class.

- over_ratio:

  A numeric value for the ratio of the minority-to-majority frequencies.
  The default value (1) means that all other levels are sampled up to
  have the same frequency as the most occurring level. A value of 0.5
  would mean that the minority levels will have (at most)
  (approximately) half as many rows as the majority level. See
  `vignette("ratio", package = "themis")` for more details.

- distance:

  A character string specifying the distance metric used for nearest
  neighbor calculations, defaulting to `"euclidean"`. The available
  metrics fall into three groups.

  `"euclidean"`, `"cosine"`, and `"mahalanobis"` use approximate nearest
  neighbors via the RANN package and scale well to large datasets.

  `"squared_chord"`, `"matusita"`, `"hellinger"`, and `"bhattacharyya"`
  are probability-divergence measures that treat each row as a
  distribution over the predictors, so they require non-negative values.
  `"hellinger"` and `"bhattacharyya"` further require each row to sum
  to 1. All four also use the RANN package and scale well to large
  datasets.

  `"manhattan"`, `"chebyshev"`, `"canberra"`, `"soergel"`,
  `"lorentzian"`, `"jeffreys"`, `"topsoe"`, `"jensen-shannon"`,
  `"jensen_difference"`, `"taneja"`, and `"kumar-johnson"` compute an
  exact all-pairs distance matrix. This takes time and memory
  proportional to the square of the number of observations in a class,
  so these are best suited to smaller datasets. Everything from
  `"canberra"` onwards is a probability divergence requiring
  non-negative values, is provided by the philentropy package (which
  must be installed separately), and in the case of `"jeffreys"`,
  `"taneja"`, and `"kumar-johnson"` requires strictly positive values,
  since those divide by individual predictor values.

  The probability divergences are meaningful for compositional
  predictors such as proportions or counts normalized per observation,
  and are generally not appropriate for standardized predictors.

## Value

A data.frame or tibble, depending on type of `df`.

## Details

ADASYN is an extension of SMOTE that adaptively generates synthetic
minority class examples based on the local distribution of each minority
instance. Instead of generating the same number of synthetic examples
for every minority instance, ADASYN generates more synthetic examples
for instances that are harder to learn, specifically those surrounded by
more majority class neighbors. This focuses synthetic data generation on
the difficult boundary regions of the minority class, resulting in a
more informative augmentation than standard SMOTE.

All columns used in this function must be numeric with no missing data.
