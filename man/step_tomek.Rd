\usage{
step_tomek(
  recipe,
  ...,
  role = NA,
  trained = FALSE,
  column = NULL,
  skip = TRUE,
  seed = sample.int(10^5, 1),
  id = rand_id("tomek")
)
}
\arguments{
\item{recipe}{A recipe object. The step will be added to the
sequence of operations for this recipe.}

\item{...}{One or more selector functions to choose which
variable is used to sample the data. See \code{\link[=selections]{selections()}}
for more details. The selection should result in \emph{single
factor variable}. For the \code{tidy} method, these are not
currently used.}

\item{role}{Not used by this step since no new variables are
created.}

\item{trained}{A logical to indicate if the quantities for
preprocessing have been estimated.}

\item{column}{A character string of the variable name that will
be populated (eventually) by the \code{...} selectors.}

\item{skip}{A logical. Should the step be skipped when the
recipe is baked by \code{\link[recipes:bake]{bake()}}? While all operations are baked
when \code{\link[recipes:prep]{prep()}} is run, some operations may not be able to be
conducted on new data (e.g. processing the outcome variable(s)).
Care should be taken when using \code{skip = TRUE} as it may affect
the computations for subsequent operations.}

\item{seed}{An integer that will be used as the seed when
applied.}

\item{id}{A character string that is unique to this step to identify it.}
}
\value{
An updated version of \code{recipe} with the new step
added to the sequence of existing steps (if any). For the
\code{tidy} method, a tibble with columns \code{terms} which is
the variable used to sample.
}
\description{
\code{step_tomek} creates a \emph{specification} of a recipe
step that removes majority class instances of tomek links. Using
\code{\link[unbalanced:ubTomek]{unbalanced::ubTomek()}}.
}
\details{
The factor variable used to balance around must only have 2 levels. All
other variables must be numerics with no missing data.

A tomek link is defined as a pair of points from different classes and are
each others nearest neighbors.

All columns in the data are sampled and returned by \code{\link[=juice]{juice()}}
and \code{\link[=bake]{bake()}}.

When used in modeling, users should strongly consider using the
option \code{skip = TRUE} so that the extra sampling is \emph{not}
conducted outside of the training set.
}
\section{Tidying}{
When you \code{\link[=tidy.recipe]{tidy()}} this step, a tibble with columns \code{terms}
(the selectors or variables selected) will be returned.
