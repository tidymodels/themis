\usage{
step_smotenc(
  recipe,
  ...,
  role = NA,
  trained = FALSE,
  column = NULL,
  over_ratio = 1,
  neighbors = 5,
  skip = TRUE,

}
\arguments{
\item{recipe}{A recipe object. The step will be added to the
sequence of operations for this recipe.}

\item{...}{One or more selector functions to choose which
variable is used to sample the data. See \code{\link[=selections]{selections()}}
for more details. The selection should result in \emph{single
factor variable}. For the \code{tidy} method, these are not
currently used.}

\item{role}{Not used by this step since no new variables are
created.}

\item{trained}{A logical to indicate if the quantities for
preprocessing have been estimated.}

\item{column}{A character string of the variable name that will
be populated (eventually) by the \code{...} selectors.}

\item{over_ratio}{A numeric value for the ratio of the
majority-to-minority frequencies. The default value (1) means
that all other levels are sampled up to have the same
frequency as the most occurring level. A value of 0.5 would mean
that the minority levels will have (at most) (approximately)
half as many rows than the majority level.}

\item{neighbors}{An integer. Number of nearest neighbor that are used
to generate the new examples of the minority class.}

\item{skip}{A logical. Should the step be skipped when the
recipe is baked by \code{\link[recipes:bake]{bake()}}? While all operations are baked
when \code{\link[recipes:prep]{prep()}} is run, some operations may not be able to be
conducted on new data (e.g. processing the outcome variable(s)).
Care should be taken when using \code{skip = TRUE} as it may affect
the computations for subsequent operations.}

\item{seed}{An integer that will be used as the seed when
smote-ing.}

\item{id}{A character string that is unique to this step to identify it.}
}
\value{
An updated version of \code{recipe} with the new step
added to the sequence of existing steps (if any). For the
\code{tidy} method, a tibble with columns \code{terms} which is
the variable used to sample.
}
\description{
\code{step_smotenc} creates a \emph{specification} of a recipe step that generate new
examples of the  minority class using nearest neighbors of these cases.
Gower's distance is used to handle mixed data types. For categorical
variables, the most common category along neighbors is chosen.
}
\details{
The parameter \code{neighbors} controls the way the new examples are created.
For each currently existing minority class example X new examples will be
created (this is controlled by the parameter \code{over_ratio} as mentioned
above). These examples will be generated by using the information from the
\code{neighbors} nearest neighbor of each example of the minority class.
The parameter \code{neighbors} controls how many of these neighbor are used.

All columns in the data are sampled and returned by \code{\link[=juice]{juice()}}
and \code{\link[=bake]{bake()}}.

Columns can be numeric and categorical with no missing data.

When used in modeling, users should strongly consider using the
option \code{skip = TRUE} so that the extra sampling is \emph{not}
conducted outside of the training set.

\section{Tidying}{
When you \code{\link[=tidy.recipe]{tidy()}} this step, a tibble with columns \code{terms}
(the selectors or variables selected) will be returned.
