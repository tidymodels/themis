**themis** contains extra steps for the
[`recipes`](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=recipes) package for
dealing with unbalanced data. The name **themis** is that of the
[ancient Greek
god](https://thishollowearth.wordpress.com/2012/07/02/god-of-the-week-themis/)
who is typically depicted with a balance.

## Installation

You can install the released version of themis from
[CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("themis")
```

Install the development version from GitHub with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("tidymodels/themis")
```

## Example

Following is a example of using the
[SMOTE](https://jair.org/index.php/jair/article/view/10302/24590)
algorithm to deal with unbalanced data

``` r
library(recipes)
library(modeldata)
library(themis)

data("credit_data", package = "modeldata")

credit_data0 <- credit_data |>
  filter(!is.na(Job))

count(credit_data0, Job)
#>         Job    n
#> 1     fixed 2805
#> 2 freelance 1024
#> 3    others  171
#> 4   partime  452

ds_rec <- recipe(Job ~ Time + Age + Expenses, data = credit_data0) |>
  step_impute_mean(all_predictors()) |>
  step_smote(Job, over_ratio = 0.25) |>
  prep()

ds_rec |>
  bake(new_data = NULL) |>
  count(Job)
#> # A tibble: 4 Ã— 2
#>   Job           n
#>   <fct>     <int>
#> 1 fixed      2805
#> 2 freelance  1024
#> 3 others      701
#> 4 partime     701
```

## Methods

Below is some unbalanced data. Used for examples latter.

``` r
example_data <- data.frame(class = letters[rep(1:5, 1:5 * 10)],
                           x = rnorm(150))

library(ggplot2)

example_data |>
  ggplot(aes(class)) +
  geom_bar()
```

<img src="man/figures/README-unnamed-chunk-2-1.png" alt="Bar chart with 5 columns. class on the x-axis and count on the y-axis. Class a has height 10, b has 20, c has 30, d has 40, and e has 50." width="100%" />

### Upsample / Over-sampling

The following methods all share the tuning parameter `over_ratio`, which
is the ratio of the minority-to-majority frequencies.

| name | function | Multi-class |
|----|----|----|
| Random minority over-sampling with replacement | `step_upsample()` | :heavy_check_mark: |
| Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique | `step_smote()` | :heavy_check_mark: |
| Borderline SMOTE-1 | `step_bsmote(method = 1)` | :heavy_check_mark: |
| Borderline SMOTE-2 | `step_bsmote(method = 2)` | :heavy_check_mark: |
| Adaptive synthetic sampling approach for imbalanced learning | `step_adasyn()` | :heavy_check_mark: |
| Generation of synthetic data by Randomly Over Sampling Examples | `step_rose()` |  |

By setting `over_ratio = 1` you bring the number of samples of all
minority classes equal to 100% of the majority class.

``` r
recipe(~., example_data) |>
  step_upsample(class, over_ratio = 1) |>
  prep() |>
  bake(new_data = NULL) |>
  ggplot(aes(class)) +
  geom_bar()
```

<img src="man/figures/README-unnamed-chunk-3-1.png" alt="Bar chart with 5 columns. class on the x-axis and count on the y-axis. class a, b, c, d, and e all have a height of 50." width="100%" />

and by setting `over_ratio = 0.5` we upsample any minority class with
less samples then 50% of the majority up to have 50% of the majority.

``` r
recipe(~., example_data) |>
  step_upsample(class, over_ratio = 0.5) |>
  prep() |>
  bake(new_data = NULL) |>
  ggplot(aes(class)) +
  geom_bar()
```

<img src="man/figures/README-unnamed-chunk-4-1.png" alt="Bar chart with 5 columns. class on the x-axis and count on the y-axis. Class a has height 25, b has 25, c has 30, d has 40, and e has 50." width="100%" />

### Downsample / Under-sampling

Most of the the following methods all share the tuning parameter
`under_ratio`, which is the ratio of the majority-to-minority
frequencies.

| name | function | Multi-class | under_ratio |
|----|----|----|----|
| Random majority under-sampling with replacement | `step_downsample()` | :heavy_check_mark: | :heavy_check_mark: |
| NearMiss-1 | `step_nearmiss()` | :heavy_check_mark: | :heavy_check_mark: |
| Extraction of majority-minority Tomek links | `step_tomek()` |  |  |

By setting `under_ratio = 1` you bring the number of samples of all
majority classes equal to 100% of the minority class.

``` r
recipe(~., example_data) |>
  step_downsample(class, under_ratio = 1) |>
  prep() |>
  bake(new_data = NULL) |>
  ggplot(aes(class)) +
  geom_bar()
```

<img src="man/figures/README-unnamed-chunk-5-1.png" alt="Bar chart with 5 columns. class on the x-axis and count on the y-axis. Class a, b, c, d, and e all have a height of 10." width="100%" />

and by setting `under_ratio = 2` we downsample any majority class with
more then 200% samples of the minority class down to have to 200%
samples of the minority.

``` r
recipe(~., example_data) |>
  step_downsample(class, under_ratio = 2) |>
  prep() |>
  bake(new_data = NULL) |>
  ggplot(aes(class)) +
  geom_bar()
```

<img src="man/figures/README-unnamed-chunk-6-1.png" alt="Bar chart with 5 columns. class on the x-axis and count on the y-axis. Class a has height 10, b, c, d, and e have ha height of 20." width="100%" />
